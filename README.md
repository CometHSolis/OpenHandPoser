# OpenHandPoser
Open Hand Poser is a VR hand poser that should universally work with any hands or system.

This package has 2 different Posers and examples, The normal poser, and the Hand-Specific poser. The normal poser allows for every bone to move at once, while the hand-specific one allows each finger to move individually.
